# Facial-landmark-detection
This project implements a deep learning pipeline to detect 68 facial landmarks using the 300W dataset. It leverages PyTorch and a modified ResNet-18 model for precise landmark regression on grayscale facial images.

ðŸ”§ Tools & Frameworks Used
PyTorch â€“ model building, training, and evaluation

Torchvision â€“ pretrained ResNet18 and data transformations

OpenCV, PIL, imutils â€“ image preprocessing and augmentation

XML Parsing â€“ to extract annotations from 300W XML files

Matplotlib â€“ visual comparison of predicted vs. actual landmarks

ðŸ“¦ Features
Custom Dataset class to parse XML annotations

Data augmentation: cropping, rotation, resizing, and color jitter

Landmark normalization and denormalization

Model checkpointing with best validation loss

Visualization of predictions vs. ground-truth landmarks

ðŸ“ˆ Results
Uses MSELoss to regress 68 (x, y) landmark coordinates

Trained and validated with dynamic plotting for comparison

Final model saved as face_landmarks.pth

ðŸ’¡ Future Improvements
Add facial bounding box detector for end-to-end inference

Explore lightweight models (MobileNetV2, EfficientNet)

Train on color images for robustness to lighting variation
